Challange - 3 : Chat app CSS illustration
Hello everyoneâœ‹, I just completed the Chat App CSS Illustration challenge on Frontend Mentor, where I recreated a modern, visually appealing chat UI using only HTML and CSS. This project was really a big deal for me because when i took the challenge i thought that i will have to work with image, but it was not i created the whole chat interface which you might assume image in the challenge. 

Comment out your thoughts and opinions about this challenge. ðŸ˜Š

âœ¨ Project Highlights:
âœ… Modern UI Design â€“ A sleek and intuitive chat interface 
âœ… Pure HTML & CSS â€“ No JavaScript or frameworks, just clean and structured code
âœ… Fully Responsive â€“ Adapts seamlessly to all screen sizes
âœ… Gradient & Shadow Effects â€“ Enhancing aesthetics with smooth color transitions
âœ… Typography & Spacing â€“ Well-balanced text and layout for readability
âœ… Interactive Elements â€“ Hover effects and well-aligned components

This challenge pushed me to refine my CSS positioning, flexbox, and responsiveness techniques, making it a great practice for frontend developers looking to build engaging UIs.
