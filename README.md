Challange - 3 : Chat app CSS illustration <br>
Hello everyoneâœ‹, I just completed the Chat App CSS Illustration challenge on Frontend Mentor, where I recreated a modern, visually appealing chat UI using only HTML and CSS. This project was really a big deal for me because when i took the challenge i thought that i will have to work with image, but it was not i created the whole chat interface which you might assume image in the challenge.  <br><br>

âœ¨ Project Highlights: <br>
âœ… Modern UI Design â€“ A sleek and intuitive chat interface  <br>
